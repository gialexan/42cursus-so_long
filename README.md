# So_long
This is the first graphic project at [42](https://www.42sp.org.br).

### What is so_long?
So_long is an individual project in [42](https://www.42sp.org.br) that requires us to create a very small 2D game.
Its purpose is to make you work with textures, sprites, and some other very basic gameplay elements using [MinilibX](https://harm-smits.github.io/42docs/libs/minilibx/introduction.html).
